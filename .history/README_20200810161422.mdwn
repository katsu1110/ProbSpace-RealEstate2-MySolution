# My Solution to ProbSpace Real State Price Prediction Challenge 2

I thank organizers for hosting this great tabular data science competition.

The competition URL is [here](https://prob.space/competitions/re_real_estate_2020).

## Solution Summary

- Features : some one-hot features (e.g. 'usage'), 'is_nan' as a feature, etc without use of ```published_land_price.csv```.
- Validation Strategy: KFold with shuffle=True. 
- Model : stacking ensemble of GBDTs (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) and NN (MLP), using Bayesian Ridge.
- ['Leaked data'](https://prob.space/competitions/re_real_estate_2020/discussions/masato8823-Post9982d5b9dcd6a33111e0) were used for both training and submission.

As the evaluation metric is RMSLE, the target values were converted into pseudo-normal by taking ```np.log1p```. The predicted values were converted back by taking ```np.expm1```.

Train and test were split by '取引時点', so blindly using this variable for modeling exploded some predictions (in my case). Eventually I binned this variable so that data >= 2015 has the same value (including all test data). 

Seed average was used for some light-models to stabilize their performances.
